A stroy about help beween countries
What you will be told about...
If you check today's news, you will probably see things like "Trump did something stupid again" or "a war as been declared". Generally, there are not a lof of good news in the actuality. So we thought it'd be nice, for once, to talk about not countires making war, but helping each other. Help is a big word. It could be an economic help, it could be help during a war and so on... To make our work, we use a database that count all articles that talked about a country helping another one from 1979 to 2016.
